      <img src="images/aboutOilPainting.jpg" alt="oilpainting" width="100%">
      <p>Janet Mazenier is a New Zealand artist best known for her paintings of architectural spaces.  In her work, Janet identifies and investigates the ongoing relationship between humans and the architecture of their surroundings, encouraging a reflective approach to wonder why some spaces are left vacant, and others populated.</p>
      <p>Having lived in Wellington for most of her working life in business before taking up painting fulltime, Janet now resides in Devonport, Auckland.  She recently graduated with a Bachelors Degree in Fine Art (painting) from Whitecliffe School of Art and Design.</p>
      <p>She has had solo exhibitions and has participated in many group exhibitions.  Janet has been a finalist in competitions, winning the award of “new artist” in Auckland’s East Art Awards in 2008.</p>
      <p>Janet's work is held in private collections in England, Australia and New Zealand. Her work is represented by the Flagstaff Gallery in Devonport, Auckland, New Zealand.</p>
