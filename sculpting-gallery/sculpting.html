        <h2>Clay and classes</h2>
        <p>I teach sculpting classes throughout New Zealand using PalTiya clay (<a href="http://www.paltiya.com/">www.paltiya.com</a>). As you can see we’ve had great fun recently with an Artweek community build that was held in Devonport – over 300 people attended during the week we were doing this!</p>
        <p>As well as teaching classes and facilitating large group sculpture builds, I am also a reseller of the clay in the Auckland area. Please contact me on 021944556 or <a href="mailto:janet.mazenier@gmail.com">janet.mazenier@gmail.com</a> if you wish to buy the clay.</p>
        <h3>Prices</h3>
        <p>4kg pail - $54.00 incl GST</p>
        <p>20 kg pail - $154.00 incl GST</p>
        <p>*note prices do not include shipping.</p>
        <p>A half day class will result in participants being confident about producing a small sculpture using the PalTiya sculpting processes. Participants can take their sculpture home (together with their 4kg pail of clay).</p>
        <p>A full day class allows participants to produce two or more sculptures, or one large-ish sculpture which can be taken home.</p>
        <p>Class prices are agreed with participants depending on whether a half or full day class is required. All materials are included in the class price.</p>
        <p>Prices for this range from $80-$160 per person. Participants will take home their sculpture/s plus clay. Note that any venue hire charges are in addition to this.</p>
